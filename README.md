## Strategy Description

The Golden Waves MT5 strategy is designed to trade on the MetaTrader 5 platform. It uses a simple approach based on profit targets and stop loss levels.

The strategy works as follows:

1. The initial deposit is set to $250.
2. The available funds are checked to ensure they are sufficient to start trading.
3. The position size is calculated based on the available funds.
4. If there is an existing position, it is checked if the profit target or stop loss level is reached. If so, the position is closed.
5. If there is no existing position and the lot size is greater than 0, a new position is opened.

## Constants

The following constants are defined in the code:

- `INITIAL_DEPOSIT`: The initial deposit amount in the account.
- `PROFIT_TARGET`: The target profit level for closing a position.
- `STOP_LOSS`: The stop loss level for closing a position.

## Functions
